      "summary": "Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable generation quality,\nalbeit requiring longer training iterations and numerous inference steps. In\neach denoising step, diffusion transformers encode the noisy inputs to extract\nthe lower-frequency semantic component and then decode the higher frequency\nwith identical modules. This scheme creates an inherent optimization dilemma:\nencoding low-frequency semantics necessitates reducing high-frequency\ncomponents, creating tension between semantic encoding and high-frequency\ndecoding. To resolve this challenge, we propose a new\n\\color{ddtD}ecoupled \\color{ddtD}iffusion\n\\color{ddtT}ransformer~(\\color{ddtDDT}), with a decoupled\ndesign of a dedicated condition encoder for semantic extraction alongside a\nspecialized velocity decoder. Our experiments reveal that a more substantial\nencoder yields performance improvements as model size increases. For ImageNet\n256times256, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of\n{1.31 FID}~(nearly 4times faster training convergence compared to previous\ndiffusion transformers). For ImageNet 512times512, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a\nnew state-of-the-art FID of 1.28. Additionally, as a beneficial by-product, our\ndecoupled architecture enhances inference speed by enabling the sharing\nself-condition between adjacent denoising steps. To minimize performance\ndegradation, we propose a novel statistical dynamic programming approach to\nidentify optimal sharing strategies.",

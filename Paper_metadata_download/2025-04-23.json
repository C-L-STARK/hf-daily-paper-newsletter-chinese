Our findings reveal that, despite significant investments\namounting to tens of millions of dollars, English remains significantly\noverrepresented in these benchmarks.

To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video\ncontent, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the\nraw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the\nediting components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models\nmust process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong\nbackground knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw\nvideos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this\nreport, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a\nwide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on\ntemporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos\ncorresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent\nediting. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong\ntemporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain\nqueries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also\npresent the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video\nduration: significantly longer than existing temporal retrival datasets, 2)\nAudio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query\nlengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually\nannotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation\nover multiple time ranges.

      "summary": "Controllable character animation remains a challenging problem, particularly\nin handling rare poses, stylized characters, character-object interactions,\ncomplex illumination, and dynamic scenes. To tackle these issues, prior work\nhas largely focused on injecting pose and appearance guidance via elaborate\nbypass networks, but often struggles to generalize to open-world scenarios. In\nthis paper, we propose a new perspective that, as long as the foundation model\nis powerful enough, straightforward model modifications with flexible\nfine-tuning strategies can largely address the above challenges, taking a step\ntowards controllable character animation in the wild. Specifically, we\nintroduce RealisDance-DiT, built upon the Wan-2.1 video foundation model. Our\nsufficient analysis reveals that the widely adopted Reference Net design is\nsuboptimal for large-scale DiT models. Instead, we demonstrate that minimal\nmodifications to the foundation model architecture yield a surprisingly strong\nbaseline. We further propose the low-noise warmup and \"large batches and small\niterations\" strategies to accelerate model convergence during fine-tuning while\nmaximally preserving the priors of the foundation model. In addition, we\nintroduce a new test dataset that captures diverse real-world challenges,\ncomplementing existing benchmarks such as TikTok dataset and UBC fashion video\ndataset, to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method.

    "summary": "Controllable character animation remains a challenging problem, particularly\nin handling rare poses, stylized characters, character-object interactions,\ncomplex illumination, and dynamic scenes. To tackle these issues, prior work\nhas largely focused on injecting pose and appearance guidance via elaborate\nbypass networks, but often struggles to generalize to open-world scenarios.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain\ncomputationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address\nthis, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into\nsmaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher\nLLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual\nknowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited\ncapability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for\ntransferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from\nLLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent\ndistillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method\ncalled first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated\ntrajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for\nimproving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight\nreasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both\nin-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small\nas 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier\nlarger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the\npotential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small\nagents.

      "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex tasks using Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning. However, their tendency to overthinking leads to unnecessarily\nlengthy reasoning chains, dramatically increasing inference costs. To mitigate\nthis issue, we introduce VeriThinker, a novel approach for CoT compression.\nUnlike conventional methods that fine-tune LRMs directly on the original\nreasoning task using synthetic concise CoT data, we innovatively fine-tune the\nmodel solely through an auxiliary verification task. By training LRMs to\naccurately verify the correctness of CoT solutions, the LRMs inherently become\nmore discerning about the necessity of subsequent self-reflection steps,\nthereby effectively suppressing overthinking. Extensive experiments validate\nthat VeriThinker substantially reduces reasoning chain lengths while\nmaintaining or even slightly improving accuracy.

    "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex tasks using Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning. However, their tendency to overthinking leads to unnecessarily\nlengthy reasoning chains, dramatically increasing inference costs. To mitigate\nthis issue, we introduce VeriThinker, a novel approach for CoT compression.\nUnlike conventional methods that fine-tune LRMs directly on the original\nreasoning task using synthetic concise CoT data, we innovatively fine-tune the\nmodel solely through an auxiliary verification task. By training LRMs to\naccurately verify the correctness of CoT solutions, the LRMs inherently become\nmore discerning about the necessity of subsequent self-reflection steps,\nthereby effectively suppressing overthinking. Extensive experiments validate\nthat VeriThinker substantially reduces reasoning chain lengths while\nmaintaining or even slightly improving accuracy.

While recent methods rely\non externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame\nsmoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise\nseeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise\nSelection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality\nnoise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA\n(Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that\nmeasures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to\nestimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time\ndeployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables\nscore estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention\nlayers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video\nquality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference\ntime, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise\nselection in video diffusion.

However, they frequently exhibit a problematic\nreliance on familiar reasoning patterns, a phenomenon we term reasoning\nrigidity. Despite explicit instructions from users, these models often\noverride clearly stated conditions and default to habitual reasoning\ntrajectories, leading to incorrect conclusions. This behavior presents\nsignificant challenges, particularly in domains such as mathematics and logic\npuzzle, where precise adherence to specified constraints is critical. To\nsystematically investigate reasoning rigidity, a behavior largely unexplored in\nprior work, we introduce a expert-curated diagnostic set, . Our\ndataset includes specially modified variants of existing mathematical\nbenchmarks, namely AIME and MATH500, as well as well-known puzzles deliberately\nredesigned to require deviation from familiar reasoning strategies. Using this\ndataset, we identify recurring contamination patterns that occur when models\ndefault to ingrained reasoning. Specifically, we categorize this contamination\ninto three distinctive modes: (i) Interpretation Overload, (ii) Input Distrust,\nand (iii) Partial Instruction Attention, each causing models to ignore or\ndistort provided instructions. We publicly release our diagnostic set to\nfacilitate future research on mitigating reasoning rigidity in language models.",

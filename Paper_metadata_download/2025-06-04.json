However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles,\nearnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the\nreal-world dynamics of financial meetings. To address this gap, we propose a\nnovel benchmark called M^3FinMeeting, which is a multilingual,\nmulti-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting\nunderstanding. First, M^3FinMeeting supports English, Chinese, and\nJapanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse\nlinguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by\nthe Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark\nspans a broad range of financial activities. Finally,\nM^3FinMeeting includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer\n(QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and\ncomprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven\npopular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have\nsignificant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nM^3FinMeeting as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting\ncomprehension skills.",

    "summary": "Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have led to the\ndevelopment of new benchmarks for evaluating their performance in the financial\ndomain. However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles,\nearnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the\nreal-world dynamics of financial meetings. To address this gap, we propose a\nnovel benchmark called M^3FinMeeting, which is a multilingual,\nmulti-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting\nunderstanding. First, M^3FinMeeting supports English, Chinese, and\nJapanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse\nlinguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by\nthe Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark\nspans a broad range of financial activities. Finally,\nM^3FinMeeting includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer\n(QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and\ncomprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven\npopular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have\nsignificant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nM^3FinMeeting as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting\ncomprehension skills.",

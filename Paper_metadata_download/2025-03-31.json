However, existing approaches\npredominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final\nhidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We\nargue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth,\nstruggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a\nnuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose ReaRec, the first inference-time\ncomputing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user\nrepresentations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec\nautoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential\nrecommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to\ndecouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space.\nMoreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods,\nEnsemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to\nfurther effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments\non five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures\ndemonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec.\nRemarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the\nperformance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by\napproximately 30\\%-50\\%. Thus, we believe this work can open a new and\npromising avenue for future research in inference-time computing for sequential\nrecommendation.",

While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for\nreward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we\nadopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient\nascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional\nline of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the\nreward function to accelerate convergence.

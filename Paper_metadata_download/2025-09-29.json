Inspired by\nthis, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision\nby organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts\nserve as the context to guide outputs.

      "summary": "We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language\nmodel that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining\nexceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,\ntwo-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local\ncontent recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout\nanalysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing\nthe computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second\nstage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on\nnative-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving\nfine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support\nthis strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,\nlarge-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,\nMinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both\ngeneral-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,\nwhile maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.",

    "title": "MinerU2.5: A Decoupled Vision-Language Model for Efficient\n  High-Resolution Document Parsing",
    "summary": "We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language\nmodel that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining\nexceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,\ntwo-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local\ncontent recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout\nanalysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing\nthe computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second\nstage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on\nnative-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving\nfine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support\nthis strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,\nlarge-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,\nMinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both\ngeneral-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,\nwhile maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.",

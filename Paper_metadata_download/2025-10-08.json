    "summary": "Diffusion language models promise bidirectional context and infilling\ncapabilities that autoregressive coders lack, yet practical systems remain\nheavyweight. We introduce CoDA, a 1.7B-parameter diffusion coder trained on TPU\nwith a fully open-source training pipeline. CoDA pairs large-scale diffusion\npre-training with code-centric mid-training and instruction tuning, enabling\nconfidence-guided sampling that keeps inference latency competitive. On\nHumaneval, MBPP, and EvalPlus, CoDA-1.7B-Instruct matches or surpasses\ndiffusion models up to 7B parameters. Our release includes model checkpoints,\nevaluation harnesses, and TPU training pipelines to accelerate research on\nlightweight diffusion-based coding assistants.",

We introduce AInstein, a framework\nfor testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems\nusing only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific\nfine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach\nextracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,\nthen tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical\nsolutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,\nreview, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on\n1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),\nusing an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by\ntargeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success\nRate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with\nhuman-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original\napproaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible\nsolutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving\nability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide\nthe first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as\nautonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential\nand their current limitations.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a\nwide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects\ngenuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework\nfor testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems\nusing only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific\nfine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach\nextracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,\nthen tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical\nsolutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,\nreview, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on\n1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),\nusing an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by\ntargeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success\nRate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with\nhuman-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original\napproaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible\nsolutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving\nability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide\nthe first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as\nautonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential\nand their current limitations.",

      "summary": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective\nmethod for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of beta-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\nbeta values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on\nHigh Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.\nOur results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to\npreference alignment.",

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

      "summary": "Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building\nvision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to\neffective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D\nsignals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the\nspatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D\ninputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,\nand (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and\noutput spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a\nscalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability\nto predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments\nshow the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and\neffectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across\nthree simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate\nfrom 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better\nperformance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average\nsuccess rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing\nbaseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,\nBridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It\ngeneralizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual\ndisturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a\nsuccess rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,\nhighlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

    "title": "BridgeVLA: Input-Output Alignment for Efficient 3D Manipulation Learning\n  with Vision-Language Models",
    "summary": "Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building\nvision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to\neffective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D\nsignals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the\nspatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D\ninputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,\nand (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and\noutput spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a\nscalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability\nto predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments\nshow the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and\neffectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across\nthree simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate\nfrom 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better\nperformance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average\nsuccess rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing\nbaseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,\nBridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It\ngeneralizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual\ndisturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a\nsuccess rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,\nhighlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday\napplications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and\nunderlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model\npersonality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with\ndiverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific\ndiscoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking\nkey events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires\nreasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small\nmodels like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as\nClaude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another\nLLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection\nand classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits:\nfor instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal\ndynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When\nanalyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual\nframing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors\nstep-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability,\nmaking them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.",

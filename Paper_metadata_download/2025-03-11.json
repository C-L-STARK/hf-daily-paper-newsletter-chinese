      "summary": "State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to\nTransformers, mitigating their quadratic computational cost. However, the\napplication of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to SSMs remains\nlargely unexplored. In particular, prompt-based methods like Prompt Tuning and\nPrefix-Tuning, which are widely used in Transformers, do not perform well on\nSSMs. To address this, we propose state-based methods as a superior alternative\nto prompt-based methods. This new family of methods naturally stems from the\narchitectural characteristics of SSMs. State-based methods adjust state-related\nfeatures directly instead of depending on external prompts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a novel state-based PEFT method: State-offset Tuning. At every\ntimestep, our method directly affects the state at the current step, leading to\nmore effective adaptation. Through extensive experiments across diverse\ndatasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/furiosa-ai/ssm-state-tuning.",

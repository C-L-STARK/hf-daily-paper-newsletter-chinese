      "summary": "Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,\nrecent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the\nreasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning\ntasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks.",

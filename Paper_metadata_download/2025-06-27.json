Unified Multi-modal\nPositional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in\na shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.\nAdditionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),\nwhich leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and\nlong-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically\nchanging autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop\na multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,\nspatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This\nframework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of\nmagnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic\nfidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthe constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal\nsegmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.",

    "summary": "We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for\npromptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal\nPositional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in\na shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.\nAdditionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),\nwhich leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and\nlong-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically\nchanging autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop\na multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,\nspatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This\nframework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of\nmagnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic\nfidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthe constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal\nsegmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.",
